# JavaScript framworks/lib Battle

## This is the quest to find the best JS route for our team, here are some key wants/needs:
- low amount of deps
- mainly concerned with the view layer (light business logic)
- easy to maintain
- good support
- good documentation
- fits into our tech stack (Rails)
- agrees with our coding standards/preferences
- SPA is not the goal, but also not out of the question

#### Disclaimer: The goal was to complete a very small task with the minimum code and dependencies to create a viable solution to the problem. The feedback is based on my personal experiance and opinions. Some of the frameworks I have prior experiance with, some I did not.

## What I looked at

- #### jQuery with no "framework" (Wild West)
- #### Knockout
- #### React
- #### Vue
- #### Angular 2 (Spoiler Alert... I didn't make a demo for ng2)
